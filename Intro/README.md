# TypeScript Intro

This is the first app I'm building using TypeScript. Following along with [TypeScript: The Complete Developer's Guide [2020]](https://www.udemy.com/course/typescript-the-complete-developers-guide/) on Udemy.
The goal of this app is to make a network request to fetch some JSON and print the result.

### What I Learned

1. How to create interfaces
2. How TS helps to catch bugs in code without running it
3. Using ts-node to avoid repetitive compiling
4. Make sure to assign expected types to variables passed into functions
5. TS must be used properly in order to get error messages! It won't work if writing plain JS in a TS file
