# Typescript Overview

Typescript = JavaScript + A type system

- You are still writing JS! Only adding a bit of extra syntax

## TS Type System

- Goal: Helps us catch errors during development
  - In JS we need to run the code to find bugs, TS will let us know automatically BEFORE running the code
- Uses 'type annotations' to analyze our code
  - Comments to describe purpose of code
- Only active during development
  - Once deployed or running types are not in use anymore (browser and node doesn't know what to do with TS) --> Only JS is executed
- Doesn't provide any performance optimization
  - Different from other languages

Typescript Code (JS with type annotations) --> Typescript Compiler (command line tool that converts from TS to JS so it can be read by the browser) --> JS --> Browser or Node to execute code

**typescriptlang.org/play helps to visualize how code is translated from TS to JS**

## Summary

- Writing TS is the SAME as writing JS with some "extra documentation"
- TS has no effect on how code is executed by browser/node (no performance optimization)
- Think of TS as a friend sitting behind you while coding (helping you catch errors)
