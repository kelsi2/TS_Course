# Mastering Typed Arrays

Typed Arrays: Arrays where each element is some consistent type of value

- Only big difference from JS is that we need to stick to elements of the same type within the array (only strings can go into a strings array, for example)

```ts
const carMakers = ['ford', 'toyota', 'chevy']; //TS automatically infers this is type string

const cars = []; //this will be type any
const cars: string[] = []; //ts knows this is string type now but don't need to use annotations unless the array has no values for ts to infer

const dates = [new Date(), new Date()]; //infers type Date[]

const carsByMake = [['f150'], ['corolla'], ['camaro']]; //infers type string[][], it knows this is a 2d array (array that contains arrays of strings)
```

## Why Typed Arrays?

- TS can do type inference when extracting values from an array

```ts
const car = carMakers[0]; //TS knows this variable is a string based on the type of the array
const myCar = carMakers.pop(); //still knows this is a string
```

- TS can prevent us from adding incompatible values to the array

```ts
carMakers.push(100); //TS will give an error because it knows this is the wrong type (should be string)
```

- We can get help with "map", "forEach", and "reduce" functions

```ts
carMakers.map((car: string): string => {
  return car.toUpperCase();
}); //TS ensures values that are being passed in are strings, we get autocomplete for all string methods on car
```

- Flexible: arrays can still contain multiple types

```ts
const importantDates = [new Date(), "2030-10-10"]; //TS infers type string | Date

const importantDates: (Date | string)[] = [new Date()]; //override type inference with manual annotation
importantDates.push("2030-10-10);
importantDates.push(new Date());
importantDates.push(100); //this will throw an error because it is neither of the given types
```

## When to use Typed Arrays

- Any time we need to represent a collection fo records with some arbitrary sort order
- Tuples are very similar to arrays (specific to TS)
