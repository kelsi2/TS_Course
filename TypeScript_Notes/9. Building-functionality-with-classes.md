# Building Functionality with Classes

Classes: Blueprint to create an object with some fields (values) and methods (functions) to represent a "thing"

```ts
class Vehicle {
  drive(): void {
    console.log('chugga chugga');
  }

  honk(): void {
    console.log('beep');
  }
}

const vehicle = new Vehicle(); // Can access all the methods defined in the Vehicle class
vehicle.drive(); // This works because this method is defined in Vehicle class
vehicle.honk();
```

## Basic Inheritance

```ts
class Vehicle {
  drive(): void {
    console.log('chugga chugga');
  }

  honk(): void {
    console.log('beep');
  }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
  drive(): void {
    console.log('vroom'); //This overrides the parent method (Vehicle)
  }
} //car is a type of vehicle so it should have the same methods as vehicle, thus it extends Vehicle

const car = new Car();
car.drive();
car.honk(); //these run, same as they would on a vehicle
```

## Instance Method Modifiers

- Modifiers:
  - Public: Can be called anywhere at any time (default method modifier)
  - Private: Can only be called by other methods in this class
  - Protected: Can be called by other methods in this class or by other methods in child classes

```ts
class Vehicle {
  protected honk(): void {
    //we can access this from child class, but not outside a class
    console.log('beep');
  }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
  private drive(): void {
    console.log('vroom'); //this can no longer be called outside of this class due to being private
    // We can't do this though because it is public in the parent class. Need to remove drive from parent class, now we can create a drive method as private, since we aren't overriding anymore
  }

  startDrivingProcess(): void {
    this.drive(); //This can call drive since it is inside the same class and can be called outside of this class
    this.honk(); // child class can access this since it's protected
  }
}

const car = new Car();
car.startDrivingProcess();
car.honk();
```

## Fields in Classes

```ts
class Vehicle {
  color: string; //this property will exist on any new instance of this class

  constructor(color: string) {
    this.color = color;
  } //constructor runs as soon as a new instance is created, must pass in any arguments we expect to receive
  //must remove initial value in the declaration for this to work, can only use one or the other
  //Another option is to remove initial declaration and the inside of the constructor and add "public" method before color to clean up code: constructor(public color: string) {} --> Can use any the same methods described above (public, private, or protected), see next example

  protected honk(): void {
    console.log('beep');
  }
}

const vehicle = new Vehicle('orange'); //this argument will override the color variable passed into the vehicle class

class Car extends Vehicle {
  private drive(): void {
    console.log('vroom');
  }

  startDrivingProcess(): void {
    this.drive();
    this.honk();
  }
}

const car = new Car();
car.startDrivingProcess();
```

## Fields with Inheritance

```ts
class Vehicle {
  constructor(public color: string) {}

  protected honk(): void {
    console.log('beep');
  }
}

const vehicle = new Vehicle('orange');

class Car extends Vehicle {
  constructor(public wheels: number, color: string) {
    // color belongs to vehicle so don't use public with it, we don't want to override the value on the parent constructor
    super(color); //need to reference the parent constructor
  }

  private drive(): void {
    console.log('vroom');
  }

  startDrivingProcess(): void {
    this.drive();
    this.honk();
  }
}

const car = new Car(4, 'red'); // since car extends vehicle, we are now expected to pass in a color argument. TS automatically calls the parent constructor since car doesn't have a constructor of its own. Once one is defined it will override the parent constructor
car.startDrivingProcess();
```

## Where to use Classes?

- Interfaces + classes === how we get really strong code reuse in TS
