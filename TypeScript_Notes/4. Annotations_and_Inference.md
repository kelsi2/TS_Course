# Type Annotations and Inference

## Type Annotations

- Type Annotations: Code we add to tell TS what type of value a variable will refer to

  - We (developers) tell TS the type. Ex:

  ```typescript
  let apples: number = 5;
  let speed: string = "fast";
  let hasName: boolean = true;

  let nothingMuch: null = null;
  let nothing: undefined = undefined;

  <!-- built in objects -->
  let now: Date = new Date();

  <!-- Array, contains nothing but strings -->
  let colors: string[] = ["red", "green", "blue"];
  let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
  let bools: boolean[] = [true, true, false];

  <!-- Classes -->
  class Car {

  }
  let car: Car = new Car();

  <!-- Object literal -->
  let point: { x: number; y: number } = {
    x: 10,
    y: 20
  };

  <!-- Function -->
  <!-- List what the function takes in, then what is expected to return. In this case use void (nothing). Everything after the = is the actual function, on the left side is a description of what the function is -->
  const logNumber: (i: number) => void = (i: number) => {
    console.log(i);
  }
  ```

## Type Inference

- Type Inference: TS tries to figure out what type of value a variable refers to

  - TS guesses the type

  * const color = "red";
    - const color === variable declaration
    - "red" === variable initialization
      - If on the same line TS figures out the type for us (e.g. it knows red is a string without us using a type annotation)
  * Use this as much as possible, preferred over annotations unless necessary
  * Type annotations are necessary in three situations:

    1. When a funciton returns the "any" type and we need to clarify the value

    ```ts
    const json = '{"x": 10, "y": 20}';
    const coordinates = JSON.parse(json);
    console.log(coordinates); //{x: 10, y: 20};
    ```

    - Coordinates type is any, after being parsed the type is still any
      - TS can't predict what is going to be returned from JSON.parse, it depends entirely on what we pass in so it gives it a type of any
      - Any means TS has no idea what type is going to be returned (it's a generic catchall value)
      - Any:
        - Type (just like string or boolean)
        - TS has no idea what this is, can't check for correct property references
        - AVOID variables with 'any" at all costs!!! (this defeats the purpose of TS)
    - To fix any add a type annotation
      ```ts
      const json = '{"x": 10, "y": 20}';
      const coordinates: { x: number; y: number } = JSON.parse(json);
      console.log(coordinates); //{x: 10, y: 20};
      ```

    2. When we declare a variable on one line then initialize it later

    ```ts
    let words = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
    let foundWord: boolean;

    for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
      if (words[i] === 'green') {
        foundWord = true; // foundWord has type any since we don't initialize it until here, add a type annotation above when declared
      }
    }
    ```

    3. When we want a variable to have a type that can't be inferred

    ```ts
    let numbers = [-10, -1, 12];
    let numberAboveZero: boolean | number = false; //two types will be assigned, number if above 0 or boolean (false) if below zero

    for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
      if (numbers[i] > 0) {
        numberAboveZero = numbers[i]; // this will cause an error, need to include a type annotation with an or operator so it can be two types
      }
    }
    ```
