# The All-Important Interface

Interfaces: Creates a new type, describing the property names and value types of an object

## Long Type Annotations

```ts
const oldCivic = {
  name: 'civic',
  year: 2000,
  broken: true,
};

const printVehicle = (vehicle: {
  name: string;
  year: number;
  broken: boolean;
}): void => {
  //type annotation is too long and hard to read, also not reusable and problematic if we add new properties later
  console.log(`Name: ${vehicle.name}`);
  console.log(`Year: ${vehicle.year}`);
  console.log(`Broken?: ${vehicle.broken}`);
};

printVehicle(oldCivic);
```

## Fixed Long Annotations with Interfaces

SOLUTION: Create an interface (a new custom type)!

- Similar to a class

```ts
interface Vehicle {
  name: string;
  year: number;
  broken: boolean;
}

const oldCivic = {
  name: 'civic',
  year: 2000,
  broken: true,
};

const printVehicle = (vehicle: Vehicle): void => {
  //Object passed into this function must match the blueprint provided by the Vehicle interface (property names and types must be identical)
  console.log(`Name: ${vehicle.name}`);
  console.log(`Year: ${vehicle.year}`);
  console.log(`Broken?: ${vehicle.broken}`);
};

printVehicle(oldCivic);
```

## Interface Syntax and Reusability

- Can use any type in an interface (eg: date, function, etc.)

```ts
interface Reportable {
  summary(): string;
}
//Since we are now only using the summary function, the interface doesn't need to include the other properties. TS knows that it has the summary function  so that's all it needs to consider something a Vehicle
//Changing name from Vehicle to Reportable since the only things we are requiring is a summary so this makes more sense
//This makes our interface more generic and reusable under more circumstances

const oldCivic = {
  name: 'civic',
  year: new Date(),
  broken: true,
  summary(): string {
    return `
      Name: ${this.name}
      Year: ${this.year}
      Broken: ${this.broken}
      `;
  },
};

const drink = {
  color: 'brown',
  carbonated: true,
  sugar: 40,
  summary(): string {
    return `My drink has ${this.sugar} grams of sugar`;
  },
};
//Represents a very different thing from oldCivic but has a summary function so can be type Reportable! This means we can use this in the printSummary function. Our code is now significantly more reusable

const printSummary = (item: Reportable): void => {
  console.log(item.summary());
};

printSummary(oldCivic);
printSummary(drink);
```

- Strategy for reusable code in TS:

  - Create functions that accept arguments that are typed with interfaces
  - Objects/classes can decide to "implement" a given interface to work with a function

- interface is a gatekeeper to some function
  - Any objects of type interface must satisfy that type before working in some function
