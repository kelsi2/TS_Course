# Tuples in TypeScript

Tuples: Array-like structure where each element represents some property of a record

- Usually contains multiple properties to describe a single thing
- Mix and match many data types

Object repersenting drink:
{
color: brown,
carbonated: true,
sugar: 40
}

- Tuples represent something similar in an array structure but we lose the property labels (we need to know what the values represent):
  [brown, true, 40]

## Tuples in Action

```ts
const drink = {
  color: 'brown',
  carbonated: true,
  sugar: 40,
};

const pepsi = ['brown', true, 40]; //TS infers type (string | number | boolean)[], we can swap the order freely since TS considers this an array not a tuple, but to use this structure we need them to be in the exact order for the values to have any meaning
pepsi[0] = 40;
pepsi[2] = 'brown'; //data model is now broken because the values have no meaning

const pepsi: [string, boolean, number] = ['brown', true, 40]; //TS now knows this array needs to have this specific order of elements, changing the order will cause an error

type Drink = [string, boolean, number]; //creating a type alias, we can replace the annotation with this in pepsi above, this is now reusabele!

const pepsi: Drink = ['brown', true, 40];
const sprite: Drink = ['clear', true, 40];
const tea: Drink = ['brown', false, 0];
```

## Why Tuples?

- Useful for CSV files for representing single rows
  - Not very helpful for most situations

```ts
const carSpecs: [number, number] = [400, 3354]; //what do these numbers actually mean? It is very hard to tell without any context

const carStats = {
  horsepower: 400,
  weight: 3354,
}; //now we know what this data means, this is a better data structure and far more useful in most situations
```
