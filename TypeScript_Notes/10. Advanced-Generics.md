# Generics

- An example of repetitive class code, the only thing that changes is the type we are returning

```ts
class ArrayOfNumbers {
  constructor(public collection: number[]) {}

  get(index: number): number {
    return this.collection[index];
  }
}

class ArrayOfStrings {
  constructor(public collection: string[]) {}

  get(index: number): string {
    return this.collection[index];
  }
}
```

- Fix the above code using generics, this way we can return any type we pass in so the code is reusable

```ts
class ArrayOfAnything<T> {
  constructor(public collection: T[]) {}

  get(index: number): T {
    return this.collection[index];
  }
}

new ArrayOfAnything<string>(["a", "b", "c"]);
```

- If we don't pass in a type TS will use Type Inference to determine the type (e.g. it knows we are passing an array of strings above even if we don't specify type string)

## Function Generics

- Example with code duplication:

```ts
function printStrings(arr: string[]): void {
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    console.log(arr[i]);
  }
}

function printNumbers(arr: number[]): void {
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    console.log(arr[i]);
  }
}
```

- Fix the above using generics, pass in any type when the function is called

```ts
function printAnything<T>(arr: T[]): void {
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    console.log(arr[i]);
  }
}

printAnything<string>(["a", "b", "c"]);
```

- Do not add square brackets to string when calling the function because we have already said we will pass in T[] when defining the function. Adding square brackets when calling would actually result in a 2D array
- Type inference happens here as well so we could not pass in string and it would still know it's type string[]
  - However it's still best practice to declare a type because this can help us catch errors (if we pass in numbers for example we can catch that error if the type is declared but not otherwise)

## Generic Constraints

- The example below will cause an error because there is no guarantee that whatever class we pass in will have a print method available
  - Add a constraint to type T to promise a print method will be available, see Printable interface
  * This will cause an error if we pass in something that does not have a print method, like an array of numbers for example (first call won't work)

```ts
class Car {
  print() {
    console.log("I am a car");
  }
}

class House {
  print() {
    console.log("I am a house");
  }
}

interface Printable {
  print(): void;
}

function printHousesOrCars<T extends Printable>(arr: T[]): void {
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    arr[i].print();
  }
}

// This won't work!
printHousesOrCars([1, 2, 3, 4]);

printHousesOrCars<House>([new House(), new House()]);
printHousesOrCars<Car>([new Car(), new Car()]);
```
