# Annotations with Functions and Objects

```ts
<!-- List what the function takes in, then what is expected to return. In this case use void (nothing). Everything after the = is the actual function, on the left side is a description of what the function is -->
const logNumber: (i: number) => void = (i: number) => {
  console.log(i);
}
```

- The type annotation on the left side is a type annotation fro the variable itself (logNumber)

- Type annotations for functions: Code we add to tell TS what type of arguments a function will receive and what type of values it will return
- Type inference for functions: TS tries to figure out what type of value a function will return (won't try to figure out the type of the arguments)

```ts
const add = (a: number, b: number): number => {
  return a + b;
};
```

- Must annotate every argument passed into a function (there is no type inference for these values!!) and one for what the function will return right after the function arguments (there is type inference for return value but it's best not to use this, this is an important safety catch in case you forget to return [this will automatically infer a void type and not tell us we made a mistake])
  - If you add the return type but don't return anything you will get an error until you return the right value type

## Anonymous Functions

```ts
function divide(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a / b;
}

const multiply = function (a: number, b: number): number {
  return a * b;
};
```

- Almost identical syntax to named functions

## Void and Never

```ts
const logger = (message: string): void => {
  console.log(message);
};
```

- No return statement because we are intentionally not returning anything so we use void type (can also use void if we are returning null or undefined)

```ts
const throwError = (message: string): never => {
  throw new Error(message);
};
```

- Throwing errors means nothing is actually being returned
  - Never type means the function will never have a return value and will never be fully executed, it will be exited early
  - This is a very rare case, in most cases we will say if (!message) throw error, else return the value which will be annotated with the type of the thing being returned rather than the error (in this case string)

## Destructuring with Annotations

```ts
const forecast = {
  date: new Date(),
  weather: 'sunny',
};

const logWeather = ({
  date,
  weather,
}: {
  date: Date;
  weather: string;
}): void => {
  console.log(date);
  console.log(weather);
};

logWeather(forecast);
```

- Destructuring allows us to avoid awkward syntax like forecast.date and forecast.weather inside the function

## Annotations Around Objects

```ts
const profile = {
  name: 'alex',
  age: 20,
  coords: {
    lat: 0,
    lng: 15,
  },
  setAge(age: number): void {
    this.age = age;
  },
};

const { age }: { age: number } = profile; //to use destructuring we must annotate the structure that the object needs to follow. This allows us to add types for more than one value in an object, we need to specify types for all of them

const {
  coords: { lat, lng },
}: { coords: { lat: number; lng: number } } = profile;
```
