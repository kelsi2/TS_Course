# Basic Types in TS

Type: Easy way to refer to different properties and functions that a value has

- Value: Anything we can assign to a variable (string, number, boolean, null, undefined, object, class, array, etc.) --> All of these have types
- Each type has access to methods or properties (ex. string can use charAt, concat, etc., same goes for array, object, etc.)
- An interface creates a new type

- Types === shortcuts to the methods associated with that thing

## Categories of Types

- Primitive Types
  - Number
  - Boolean
  - Void
  - Undefined
  - String
  - Symbol
  - Null
- Object Types
  - Functions
  - Arrays
  - Classes
  - Objects
    - Trick TS to believe one value is a different type (can't do this with primitive types)

## Why do we care about types?

- Used by TS Compiler to analyze code for errors
- Allow other engineers to understand what values are flowing around our codebase
  - Even if variable names are unclear the types can help clarify what is happening with it

* Types should be used everywhere! This is how we ensure code is high quality
